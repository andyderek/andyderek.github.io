With all the learning that has been going on in my life I'm also learning that I need to learn how to learn.  Sure I could have used a thesaurus for that sentence and perhaps learned a new word for learn (I did by the way and there aren't that may great alternatives for the word learn).

So one thing I've noticed about myself is that I tend to do best with small bits of information followed by a chance to immediately utilize that information.  For instance I just learned that Sublime Text doesn’t offer much in the way of spelling and grammar help (nor does it have a thesaurus).  That isn’t a great example.

So when I first began my quest to learn JavaScript I picked up a book called “A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript.”

I found this book to be of great use to get me started.  It is set up so that you read a few pages and then you immediately take a 20-question test on the information that you just read about.  Often times the questions were repetitive which I found annoying sometimes but helpful nonetheless.

Upon reflecting on this I realize that I might need to employ this more on my day to day coding challenges.
