First off don’t make fun of my page.  I’m going for that OG retro look.  Think GeoCities late 90s complete with broken images.

If it helps image that your are viewing this page on this computer:

I often see people use multiple short-cuts in quick succession and I'm... well I think this video sums it up pretty well:

So tonight I decided to explore a few short-cuts.  In this post I was thinking that it might be nice to include some screen shots.  But how do I do that.  Perhaps there is come combination of keys I could press...

Aha!  There is indeed:

Command-Shift-3 (takes a picture of your full screen)
Once you do this it should immediately appear on your desktop

Or

Command-Shift-4 (allows you to select the area where you want to take the screenshot) 
Once you do this a crosshair pointer will appear on the screen. If you decide that you don’t want to take the shot after all just press ESC otherwise click, hold and the drag until your selection is inside the gray box then release your click.

Okay.  Now that I figured that out I thought it might be nice to learn some Sublime Text shortcuts.  Please bear with me as I am learning these as I type this blog (and trying to learn how to write, edit and update my blog)

The first one I’m going to learn is one that I thought would be very useful if you decided to change the name of a variable in your code after using it through out your code:

First either click on or have your cursor on the variable that you wish to change.

Then press Command-D repeatedly until you’ve highlighted all the instances of the variable.  Then type in your new variable. 

But a better way might be to double click on the variable you wish to replace and then press Option-Command-F.   ESC will close this toolbar

While we are on the F key we can press Control-Command-F to enter and exit Full Screen mode.
