First off don’t make fun of my page.  I’m going for that OG retro look.  Think GeoCities late 90s complete with broken images.

I often see people use multiple short-cuts in quick succession and I left thinking to my self...

So tonight I decided to explore a few short-cuts.  In this post I was thinking that it might be nice to include some screen shots.  But how do I do that.  Perhaps there is come combination of keys I could press...

Aha!  There is indeed:

Command-Shift-3 (takes a picture of your full screen)
Once you do this it should immediately appear on your desktop

Or

Command-Shift-4 (allows you to select the area where you want to take the screenshot) 
Once you do this a crosshair pointer will appear on the screen. If you decide that you don’t want to take the shot after all just press ESC otherwise click, hold and the drag until your selection is inside the gray box then release your click.
