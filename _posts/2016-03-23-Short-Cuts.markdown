...just press Command-F.

First off don’t make fun of my page.  I’m going for that OG retro look.  Think GeoCities late 90s complete with broken images.

If it helps, imagine that your are viewing this page on this computer:

I often see people use multiple short-cuts in quick succession and I'm... well I think this video sums it up pretty well:

So tonight I decided to explore a few short-cuts(in reality I got caught up in exploring in particular).  In this post I was thinking that it might be nice to include some screen shots.  But how do I do that.  Perhaps there is come combination of keys I could press...

Aha!  There is indeed:

Command-Shift-3 (takes a picture of your full screen)
Once you do this it should immediately appear on your desktop

Or

Command-Shift-4 (allows you to select the area where you want to take the screenshot) 
Once you do this a crosshair pointer will appear on the screen. If you decide that you don’t want to take the shot after all just press ESC otherwise click, hold and the drag until your selection is inside the gray box then release your click.

Okay.  Now that I figured that out I thought it might be nice to learn some Sublime Text shortcuts.  Please bear with me as I am learning these as I type this blog (and trying to learn how to write, edit and update my blog)

When you are in a Sublime Text and you press Command-F this appears at the bottom:

![Screen shoot of Command-F]({{ andyderek.github.io }}/images/command-f.png)

Once this Bar is open at the bottom of the screen you can type in the word you are searching for and select from these options: Find, Find Prev, Find All.

If you do not have the wrap button selected ![Screen Shot of Wrap button]({{ andyderek.github.io }}/images/wrapbutton.png) then it will begin it's search where your cursor is on your page and complete the search at the end of the document.  If you do have it selected it will start where your cursor is, search until the end and then wrap back to the beginning and finally completeing it's search where you started it.

Another button that is helpful is this one: ![Screen Shot of Wrap button]({{ andyderek.github.io }}/images/wholeword.png)  If this one is selected than the find feature only finds that word (instead of finding instances of those letter combinations inside other words).

Another handy button is the Highlight Matches Button: ![Screen Shot of Wrap button]({{ andyderek.github.io }}/images/Highlightbutton.png)
This one is as described, it highlights your matches in the document(although this can also be achieved by double clicking on a word)

Research and Blogging on this subject is still in progress stay tuned....
