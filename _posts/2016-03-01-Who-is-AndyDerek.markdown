Since this is my first post I feel compelled to give a bit of background on myself.  Where I'm coming from.  Where I've been.  Where I hope to go.  So here goes...

I majored in art in college.  Seems like a solid choice with loads of career options, right?  My intention was to teach.  After graduating with a BFA I turned down a full ride for my MFA in order to live as an artist for a while.  I felt that I really wanted to pursue being an artist before I started down the road to teaching it.  After all how could I teach something that I haven't lived.  Probably not a wise choice but I wouldn't be who I am if I didn't make that choice.

I also felt strongly about being a musician.  Those (art and music) passions competed (and continue to compete) aggressively for attention.

So how did I end up deciding on coding?  That's difficult to answer.  I'm not sure I can even answer that yet.  

Most of my adult life has been spent doing odd jobs to earn money.  By and large my biggest odd job is that of a stagehand.  After putting in quite of bit of time paying my dues literally and figuratively I became a journeyman in a union.  IATSE Local 16.  I have spent many long hours working backstage and behind the scenes at parties, concerts, dance performances, conferences and yes even a tv show and a movie.

Why would you every want to give that up?  People ask.  It's the best part time job ever!  They say.  

I could write for days answering that question.  I don't know.  It has had it's time in my life.  I have sacrificed so much for it.  It's time... 

I suppose that none of this really answers any of the questions that I've been asked.  Where Am I coming from?  Where have I been?  and Where do I hope to go?  

Perhaps these question will be answered in future blogs but for now I have a lot to think about.
