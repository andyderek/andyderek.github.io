Whoa man!  That Incoming Assessment took it out of me!  I think I worked on it for an entire day.  I'm embarrassed to say how many hours.  I took a break at the request of my very supportive girlfriend, although I think she really just wanted me to cook dinner more than she was concerned with my frustration but that's okay because the break was just what I needed.  I find very often that taking a break can be very helpful.  I gave up on coding after completing the Telegraph Academy Prep course.  I just thought I couldn't hack it (pun intended).  After a month or two I picked up up again and everything I was struggling with seemed so simple.

So how did I overcome the road blocks that I ran into this time.  Well after cooking dinner and relaxing for a bit I opened up my document and I console.logged!  Console.log is my new best friend and we spent a lot of time together on that Incoming Assessment.  We got to know one another on a deeper level.  I just started console.logging everything until is stumbled up what I needed.  And that stumble turned into a sprint.  Yes, I pulled the old trip turn into a run.  You know what I'm talking about!?!  That time when you trip and then try and play it off like you're gonna start jogging.  That's what happened.  In a matter of an hour maybe two I wrapped everything up.

I must say it was a rush!  After working all day and staring at the same failure over and over.  Trying the same things in slight different ways.  That moment when I saw my code finally work...  I wanted to scream for joy!  My heart sank.  Just like any sort of thrill, it's like a drug and now I'm waiting on my next fix which I'm sure will come next week when I start my first of 12 weeks at Telegraph Academy!
