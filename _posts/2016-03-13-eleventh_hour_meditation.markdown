So Here I am.  Here we are. About to begin our 12-week journey.  I must admit I am nervous.  I'm I prepared?  Can I do this?

I've made it this far.  I can still remember riding the Bart to work in San Francisco and seeing the ad for Hack Reactor.  I brought the website up on my phone looked it over and thought to myself, "12 weeks, that's 3 months.  I could probably save up enough money to take that time off."  I had many doubts.  I still have doubts but I'm come to far now and I'm not looking back.

There have been many times where I thought about giving up and many times that I did give up but I kept coming back.  Usually it was a bad day at work.  A day, dredging thru some miserable task or other, that brought me back.  

Three interviews for Telegraph Academy.  It was like the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears.  The first time I was too confident.  The second time I wasn't confident enough.  The third time was just right.

And now as I prepare for my first day,  I still wonder, am I ready...

I got no time for that.  Gotta keep moving...
