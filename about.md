I’m Andy and I’m a software engineer.

I love challenges.  Once I get into solving programming puzzle or challenge I can not stop until it is complete.  I’ll fall asleep working on it.  I’ll even dream about it and in the morning I’m back at it.

I recently built Hacker Habitat with a couple of software engineers. It connects software engineers who are looking for temporary or permanent housing with other engineers who have rooms for rent.  I primarily worked on the front-end using React, Redux and the Sendgrid API for emailing support.

I am currently working on an app called Labor Pro for union members to help them track their jobs, hours and wages. I really enjoy working on this app because there is always more features that could be added to this app and more puzzles to be solved.
